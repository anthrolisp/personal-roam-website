<li>Therefore, techniques on data collection, transmission, storage, and mining have a huge impact on the prediction methodologies (Ran et al., 2012). Recent development in those domains have introduced the notion of big data to transportation research (Zheng et al., 2016, Jin et al., 2013); big data brings us unprecedented opportunities for achieving prediction with utmost accuracy, and it also sets new demand to reform the traffic flow prediction modeling strategies.</li>
<li>It is not an easy task to develop a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deep-learning-model">deep learning model</a> that efficiently capture the characteristics of traffic flow.</li>
<li>In the transportation field, data-driven methods especially the neural network approach have long been criticized for its explain-ability. Neural network has long been regarded as a “black box” because it is difficult to understand due to the large number of neurons, complicated structures, and non-linear function (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0090">Karlaftis and Vlahogianni, 2011</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0120">Lippi et al., 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0320">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).</li>

<li>The stated goal of the paper is for accurate prediction of traffic flow.<ul>
<li>Making estimations of the future state based on expereinces and knowledge extracted from related historical data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The historical data matters the most. Recent advances in traffic data acquisition technology has given researchers a <em>traffic data flood</em>. </li>
<li>At the time of the articles publishing, there was work in using neural networks for traffic forecasting,  but the authors raise the concern of traffic flow being complicated, with plentiful characteristics in both space and time dimensions. <ul>

<ul>
<li>The authors transition to using two different neural networks: <ul>
<li>A deep convolutional neural network is used for the spatial features of the network</li>
<li>Recurrent neural netwoks were used for the temporal data<ul>
<li>The time horizon was up recent horizon plus similar intervals of the previous day and previous week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed data was used to train an &quot;attention model&quot; to deal with the level of importance of recent traffic</li>
<li>The proposed model was evaluated on the prediction of future traffic flow on a long future horizon <ul>
<li>45 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They also analyzed the inner workings of the trained neural network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>neural networks handle non-linearities well, as well as approximating unknown functions. It is natural to apply it to traffic prediction</li>
<li>&quot;Plain&quot; neural networks suffer from their shallow-ness in the traffic space, where the input data is &quot;deep&quot;<ul>
<li>deep neural networks to the rescue!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traffic flow is similar to video and audio in that is has characteristics in both the space and time domainds<ul>
<li>traffic flow patterns at one location are more likely to be similar to another location</li>

<li><h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The real-world traffic data is aggregated into 5 minute intervals</li>
<li>The data made available to the neural networks is as follows:<ul>
<li>Say it is 6:30PM, then we want to predict 6:35, 6:45, ..., till 7:15pm .</li>
<li>To predict these 45 minutes of traffic, the model looks back<ul>
<li>105 minutes in the current day,</li>
<li>30 minutes before and after 6:30PM on the previous day</li>
<li>30 minutes before and after 6:30PM t-1 week</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The network:<ul>
<li><img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0968090X18302651-gr2.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li>It is a corridor of Interstate 405, considering only the Northbound direction<ul>
<li>33 detectors, data from PeMS</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>This paper&#39;s DNN-BTF model was compared with several different methods <ul>
<li>DNN-BTF stands for <strong>D</strong>eep <strong>N</strong>eural <strong>N</strong>etwork <strong>T</strong>raffic <strong>F</strong>low prediction model. Not sure where the <strong>B</strong> comes from...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The attention model, which weights the inputs by importance, understandably gave more importance to recent time intervals.</li>
<li>The spatial weighting was less predictable</li>
<li>Their visualization of the inner workings of the model is super well done<ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>A hybrid deep learning based traffic flow prediction method and its understanding</em> is the most cited article in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0968090X">Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</a>. I figured that I should start at the top for my 2021 experiment of summarizing a few papers a week.</p>

<li><h3 id="so-lets-get-into-it">So let&#39;s get into it:</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Why do I think this paper is so well cited? There are a couple key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p> The keywords: traffic flow prediction, neural networks, deep neural networks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The emphasis on visualization!</p>
</li>
<li><p>This paper is well written</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>More important than the keywords  </p>
